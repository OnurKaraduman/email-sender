email-sender project

Firstly, there is a txt file named “emailsender.txt” in same directory which you added user. 
There is a class named FileFactory that operates file processing features such as append to file, read from file.
UserDAO which is implemented from IUserDAO is used to use operations in FileFactory Class.
IUserDAO provides us general using. This class just operates on level of file operations. 
Business Logic works in UserService implemented IUserService.  

Workflow works:

Txt file is read and map to User model. 
Operations include methods such as findActiveUsers. 
We used findActiveUser method to find only active users from file. 
And there is a method in service layer named sendEmail with mailBody and ActiveUserList parameters. 
After, we found active users, we pass params to sendEmail method. 
Finally, email sent activeUsers.(not actually sent. Just shown on console)
Just execute UnitTest.java
